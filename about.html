                    <h2>Hi! You're probably wondering what I'm going to write here...</h2>
                    <article>
                        <p>Truth be told, I never know what to write when it comes to writing about myself. So I decided
                            that I'll start writing about how and why I made this website and as you read, maybe you'll
                            learn a couple of thing about me (and hey, maybe I'll also learn something about myself too!
                            Wouldn't that be nice.)</p>
                        <p>So, first of all, thanks for looking at this website. It's supposed to be my first "serious"
                            attempt at making something appealing to the eye, which isn't really something I have a lot
                            of experience in. Initially I thought that I'd just add some pictures and take the text from
                            Lorem Ipsum so that the pages wouldn't look empty, but as I started building the website I
                            felt like it was soulless without putting a piece of myself inside it. It's mainly because
                            of that that I'm writing all this text, and you're reading it.</p>
                        <p>Initially I was thinking about going homebuilt, self-made style of submission as I have a bit
                            of programming experience in other languages. However, I do think that nowadays most web
                            designers use frameworks like Bootstrap and Django for building their websites, so I leaned
                            on that side of the project more than creating something from ground up. Besides, the
                            Bootstrap examples in the previous courses were outdated, as it turns out, so I believed
                            that making this website using Bootstrap would also be a good learning experience for
                            Bootstrap 5.</p>

                <p>Hi! If you're reading this then I'm guessing you're here from Coursera. If not, then I'm really curious to find out how you got here. I guess it'd be possible to find a link to this website through my GitHub page, but that seems kinda unlikely. Still, it's the only other way to find this page on the internet, so congratulations for reading this part! Honestly I'm just writing this so that the page doesn't look empty. The requirement for the project includes having three separate pages with an image in each of them, so as I'm writing this I'm also thinking about what to put use as an image. I don't really feel comfortable using an image of myself, it doesn't really feel secure. I'll probably put a picture of a cat or something.</p>
                <p>So, about me I guess. Not sure what to talk about. I am a CS student and have some prior experience with HTML/CSS/JavaScript from an internship but I wish I had checked this course out before going there. It was torturous, I'm definitely not built for an office enviroment. Spending four weeks just catching up on the knowledge of others pretty much eradicated any joy I might have had during the internship. Alas, here we are. This is fun. Not the "writing about myself" part but the "picking colors, designing the webpages, seeing what looks good and what doesn't" part is fun.</p>
                <p>If you're still reading this stream of conciousness that I'm putting on here just to fill a page, then you deserve a reward. I'm not giving you any, but I guess you're free to download the cat pictures I put on the website. Consider it my way of thanking you for reading this far.</p>
