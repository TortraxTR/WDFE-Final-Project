                <h2>Hi! You're probably wondering what I'm going to write here...</h2>
                <p>Truth be told, I never know what to write when it comes to writing about myself. So I decided
                    that I'll start writing about how and why I made this website and as you read, maybe you'll
                    learn a couple of thing about me (and hey, maybe I'll also learn something about myself too!
                    Wouldn't that be nice.)</p>
                <p>So, first of all, thanks for looking at this website. It's supposed to be my first "serious"
                    attempt at making something appealing to the eye, which isn't really something I have a lot
                    of experience in. Initially I thought that I'd just add some pictures and take the text from
                    Lorem Ipsum so that the pages wouldn't look empty, but as I started building the website I
                    felt like it was soulless without putting a piece of myself inside it. It's mainly because
                    of that that I'm writing all this text, and you're reading it.</p>
                <p>Initially I was thinking about going homebuilt, self-made style of submission as I have a bit
                    of programming experience in other languages. However, I do think that nowadays most web
                    designers use frameworks like Bootstrap and Django for building their websites, so I leaned
                    on that side of the project more than creating something from ground up. Besides, the
                    Bootstrap examples in the previous courses were outdated, as it turns out, so I believed
                    that making this website using Bootstrap would also be a good learning experience for
                    Bootstrap 5.</p>
