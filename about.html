                <p>Hi! If you're reading this then I'm guessing you're here from Coursera. If not, then I'm really curious to find out how you got here. I guess it'd be possible to find a link to this website through my GitHub page, but that seems kinda unlikely. Still, it's the only other way to find this page on the internet, so congratulations for reading this part! Honestly I'm just writing this so that the page doesn't look empty. The requirement for the project includes having three separate pages with an image in each of them, so as I'm writing this I'm also thinking about what to put use as an image. I don't really feel comfortable using an image of myself, it doesn't really feel secure. I'll probably put a picture of a cat or something.</p>
                <p>So, about me I guess. Not sure what to talk about. I am a CS student and have some prior experience with HTML/CSS/JavaScript from an internship but I wish I had checked this course out before going there. It was torturous, I'm definitely not built for an office enviroment. Spending four weeks just catching up on the knowledge of others pretty much eradicated any joy I might have had during the internship. Alas, here we are. This is fun. Not the "writing about myself" part but the "picking colors, designing the webpages, seeing what looks good and what doesn't" part is fun.</p>
                <p>If you're still reading this stream of conciousness that I'm putting on here just to fill a page, then you deserve a reward. I'm not giving you any, but I guess you're free to download the cat pictures I put on the website. Consider it my way of thanking you for reading this far.</p>
