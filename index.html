                        <h2>December 25th: Midweek Musings</h2>
                        <p>It's been about a month since my lowest point,
                            and I'm glad to say that I've been feeling better and better with each passing day. Still
                            waiting on the news regarding my credit situation from the school, but otherwise there
                            hasn't
                            been any major incidents that caused me to spiral downwards like before. I might not be
                            happy,
                            but I am content with my life so it's definitely an improvement. Since I'm writing this, I
                            might
                            try to use the website as a private journal of sorts, but I don't know if I would stick with
                            it
                            after New Year's.</p>
                        <p>I'm still kind of shocked at how fast December
                            went by. It could be my age getting to me but I've stopped feeling the festivities of the
                            New
                            Year's arrival, it seems. We don't really celebrate Christmas either, so it's feeling like
                            any
                            other week of the year, other than the weather. Missing the sun already.</p>
                        <p>Fitness is going well and not well. As in, I feel
                            like I could be doing more: eating less, running more, resting properly and whatnot. But the
                            bad
                            weather combined with a general laziness has caused me to throw my end-of-the-year goals out
                            the
                            window. I've still got a target to hit in mind for January 1st and I'll probably hit it
                            (barring
                            anything major happening within the next week), but it's much more of a realistic goal than
                            the
                            one I set for myself three months ago.</p>
                        <p>Ah well. Those are the games we play with
                            ourselves I guess.</p>

                    <h3>Book Progress</h3>
                    <p>Currently reading through Rhythm of War, the
                        fourth book in the Stormlight Archive series. Still debating whether or not I should finish
                        the
                        fourth and the fifth book before I start another series, as the fifth book released rather
                        recently and I'm scared of stumbling into spoilers while I'm on the internet.</p>
